### About: 

Computers are cool. 

>"I have no doubt that in reality the future will be vastly more surprising than anything I can imagine. Now my own suspicion is that the universe is not only stranger than we suppose, but stranger than we _can_ suppose." - J. B. S. Haldane, 1927

### Projects / Thoughts:
##### Collection of work and thoughts based around computing and life. 

* Senior Capstone project
    * [Petopia!](http://petopia.azurewebsites.net) is a project myself and two other CS students [Tricia Holman](https://stormy9.github.io) and [Corrin Moser](https://github.com/CorrinM) built to bridge the gap between Pet Owners and Pet Care Providers â€” promotes establishing the connection between owners and free lance care providers who reside in the same area. The tool aims to bring both sides of the pet care world together under one roof.
